        <h1>Debugging</h1>
        <p>
          You can debug any SC process in much the same way that you would debug a normal Node.js process.
          The only difference is that because SC has multiple kinds of processes which interact with each other in
          various ways, you generally don't want to debug all of them at the same time.
          For this reason, SC allows you to provide <b>--debug-workers</b> and <b>--debug-brokers</b> CLI arguments
          to let you debug workers and brokers separately.
          Note that if you're using Node.js versions 6.3.0 and above, you can use <b>--inspect-workers</b> and <b>--inspect-brokers</b> that way you
          don't need to run an external debugger on the side.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, make sure that you are using Node.js v0.11.0+ (preferably the latest stable version).
        </p>
        <p>
          Install node-inspector globally (skip this step if you're on Node.js v6.3.0 or above):
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint">
npm install -g node-inspector</pre>

        <p>
          Then run it in a console window using:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint">
node-inspector</pre>

        <p>
          ^ You have to keep this one running in its own console (or in the background) throughout your whole
          debugging session (no need to restart it between individual debugs).
        </p>
        <p>
          To start debugging, you need to have a fresh console open. You just have to pass a <b>--debug-workers</b>,
          <b>--debug-brokers</b>, <b>--inspect-workers</b> or <b>--inspect-brokers</b> argument when you run your server.js
          file using node. Make sure you add the flags <b>after</b> the server file name or else it won't work.
        </p>
        <p>
          E.g.
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint">
node server --debug-workers</pre>
        <p>
          or
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint">
node server --debug-brokers</pre>
        <p>
          or (Node.js version >= 6.3.0)
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint">
        node server --inspect-workers</pre>
        <p>
          or (Node.js version >= 6.3.0)
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint">
        node server --inspect-brokers</pre>
        <p>
          The default debug port for the first worker is <b>5859</b>, the second worker is 5860, ... (it increments by one for each
          worker) - You should see a debug message get printed to the console telling you which debug ports are open.
        </p>
        <p>
          To open the debug console for the first worker, you need to insert this address in your Chrome browser (debug port 5859):
          <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8080/debug?ws=127.0.0.1:8080&port=5859">http://127.0.0.1:8080/debug?ws=127.0.0.1:8080&port=5859</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          You can also provide a custom starting port for the workerCluster master - The workerCluster master is the process
          which manages the SC workers - You generally don't need to debug that one. The first worker's debug port will be the specified port + 1
          and subsequent workers will +1 increment:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint">
// Our workerCluster process will be debuggable on port 5999.
// The first worker will be debuggable on port 6000.
node server --debug-workers=5999</pre>
        <p>
          This applies to brokers too:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint">
// First broker will be debuggable on port 5999.
node server --debug-brokers=5999</pre>
        <p>
          If you're using Node.js v6.3.0 or above, you can substitute the 'debug' keyword above with 'inspect' and it will work in essentially the same way.
          You should see the debugger URLs come up on the console; you can just copy them and paste them in your browser.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to debug your master process (server.js), it's the normal
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint">
node --debug-brk server</pre>
        <p>
          or for Node.js >= v6.3.0:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint">
node --inspect server</pre>

        <p>
          ^ Note that the order matters in this case too (this time <b>--debug-brk</b> or <b>--inspect</b> needs to go <b>before</b> the server argument)!
        </p>
        <p>
          When you're debugging a worker, you may occasionally want to make it break on a particular line or else it will go to the end (idle, waiting for connections).
          To do this you need to add a <b>debugger;</b> statement in your worker.js code where you want it to stop.</p>
        <p>
          Note that if you're in a worker, you will have access to a global <b>worker</b> object (in the debugger console) so you can interact with your server and do
          things like <b>worker.exchange.publish('pong', 'This is a message for the pong channel')</b> to interact with the rest of your system from your worker.
          (Note that you don't need to add <b>debugger</b> statements anywhere in your code to access this feature - The
          worker variable is exposed globally so you can access it from any scope).
        </p>
        <p>
          In the same way, when you're debugging a broker process, you will have access to a <b>broker</b> object and you can also
          interact with the broker directly through the debugger just like the worker.
        </p>
        <p>
          Slightly off-topic: If you're using multiple brokers, each broker will only manage a subset of all available channels (this is the secret sauce to SC's scalability),
          so don't be surprised if you publish() to a broker and no one gets the message - You have to call publish() on the broker which is
          responsible for that particular channel.
