        <h1>Scaling across multiple hosts</h1>
        <p>
          SocketCluster lets you scale both vertically (across multiple CPU cores on a machine/host) and horizontally (across multiple hosts).
          To scale horizontally, you can either use SCC (recommended) or implement your own solution from scratch.
          If you use SCC, then you don't need to learn about the implementation details of how SC synchronizes channel data across machines.
        </p>

        <h3>SCC</h3>
        <p>
          SCC was introduced in September 2016 - It is a set of components for scaling SC across multiple hosts.
        </p>
        <p>
          SCC is designed to be easy to setup and gives you horizontal scalability without you having to know much about what is happening behind the scenes.
          If you run SCC on top of Kubernetes, scaling up and down will be handled for you automatically.
          The complete guide to using SCC is <a href="https://github.com/SocketCluster/socketcluster/blob/master/scc-guide.md">here</a>.
          If you use SCC, you don't need to read the section below about 'Scaling Manually'.
        </p>

        <h3>Scaling Manually</h3>
        <p>
          The goal of horizontal scalability is to spread traffic between all available machines in an optimal way.
          In the context of SocketCluster, horizontal scalability boils down to two specific problems:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>How to select which host to send incoming client connections to?</li>
          <li>When one client publishes data to a channel, how can you make sure that other clients which are subscribed to that channel on a different host also receive the channel data in real-time?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          There are at several ways to approach the first challenge, for example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            You can send each client directly to one of your hosts by randomly selecting a host URL and passing it as an option to the <a href="#!/docs/api-scsocket-client">client socket's</a> connect() method.
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              You can use a load balancer to evenly distribute incoming connections to target hosts - You can use a third party service, or you can set it up yourself.
              Note that if you are using SocketCuster v1.x.x, you will need to use a sticky load balancer (e.g. stickiness based on IP address) - You do not need stickiness for versions v2.0.0 and above (this is because we do not have to support stateful HTTP polling).
              The load balancer you use needs to support WebSockets; HAProxy and new versions of NGINX should do. There is also <a href="http://github.com/SocketCluster/loadbalancer">LoadBalancer.js</a> if you want something that is
              easy to setup and optimized to work with SC.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In order to allow clients which are connected to different machines to share the same pub/sub channels, there needs to be an efficient way to synchronize channels between separate SocketCluster instances (hosts) in real-time.
          To achieve this, SocketCluster exposes a <a href="#!/docs/api-broker">Broker</a> object inside its brokerController file (broker.js) which lets you do exactly that.
          SocketCluster only provides you the interface for synchronizing instance channels - It doesn't care what technology/implementation you use behind the scenes to make this work;
          so long as it supports pub/sub and can run as a distributed cluster - MQTT (e.g. Mosquitto), AMQP (e.g. RabbitMQ), ZeroMQ and Redis are all possible options.
          The details of how to set up such a service is outside the scope of this guide - You should read up some of these technologies/protocols or use a third-party service.
        </p>
        <p>
          Assuming that you have a working pub/sub cluster which can scale across multiple machines, the actual synchronization between SC instances/machines is pretty simple -
          It can be done through SocketCluster's broker processes - Read the section on events in the <a href="#!/docs/api-broker">Broker API</a> for more info.
          In effect, your MQ service behaves like a glue between your SocketCluster instances - It also allows external services to interact with SocketCluser channels as though they were part of the same system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you have your distributed MQ service running, all you have to do is relay events between your broker processes and your message queue service using a client of your choice.
          Setting this up is simple:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>When a 'subscribe' event is emitted on a Broker instance, you need to use your MQ client subscribe to the corresponding channel in your MQ service.</li>
          <li>When the broker emits the 'unsubscribe' event, you need to also unsubscribe form the corresponding channel in the MQ service.</li>
          <li>Whenever you receive some channel data from your MQ client, you call broker.publish(channelName, data)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Note that the 'subscribe' and 'unsubscribe' events do not get triggered for individual client sockets - They are initiated by a worker process.
          The worker chooses when it needs to subscribe/unsubscribe to/from the broker. When you get a 'subscribe' event, all it means is that the current broker is
          responsible for that channel - Following the same train of thought; the 'unsubscribe' event signifies that this broker is no longer responsible for this channel.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's important to note that your SC instances could each have multiple broker processes - In this case, each broker will be responsible for a subset of all channels used by end-clients.
          When you're writing your adapter, you should never assume that all your channels will pass through the same broker.
        </p>
        <p>
          The final consideration is that it's best to deploy your MQ service in close proximity to your SC instances (or inside the same data center if possible) to minimize latency.
