        <h1>API - Session (nData) [REMOVED v1.3.0]</h1>
        <p>
          Note that this object no longer exists as of SocketCluster v1.3.0. Authentication
          is now managed using JWT tokens. See <a href="#!/docs/api-scsocket-server">SCSocket (server)</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Can be accessed using socket.session property.
        </p>
        <p>
          The session object is a session-scoped nData client which lets you manipulate session
          data within a store. It does not let you do pub/sub - For this purpose,
          you need to use the scWorker.exchange object instead. You can use any (non-pub/sub)
          method of an nData client on instances of this object: <a href="https://github.com/SocketCluster/ndata">https://github.com/SocketCluster/ndata</a>

              The session id.

        <table class="table">
          <tr>
            <td>emit(event, data)</td>
            <td>
              Emits an event (with data payload) to all sockets which belong to the current session.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>transmit(event, data)</td>
            <td>
              Emits an event to all sockets which belong to the current session except the socket
              to which the session is currently bound.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>kickOut([channel, message, callback])</td>
            <td>
              All sockets which are part of the current session will be unsubscribed from the specified
              channel. All arguments are optional - If no channel name is provided,
              it will unsubscribe this session's sockets from ALL channels. In addition,
              all client-side sockets will emit a 'kickOut' event and a 'dropOut'
              event to signify that the socket was kicked out of the channel and
              has dropped out of further messages. Note that this doesn't prevent
              the client from resubscribing to that channel later. You will need
              to update your middleware if you want to achieve this.
