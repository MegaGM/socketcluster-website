        <h1>API - Broker</h1>
        <p>
          The broker object allows you to interact directly with SocketCluster's internal data and pub/sub channels.
          This object can be accessed from inside the brokerController (broker.js file by default).
          The broker's main purpose is to allow you to synchronise SocketCluster's internal channels with external
          channels from a third-party system - This is useful if you need to scale SocketCluster horizontally across
          multiple machines.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some third-party systems which can be used to achieve horizontal scalability include RabbitMQ, Redis (as a distributed cluster),
          and various other AMQP and MQTT solutions.
          SocketCluster doesn't currently provide a plugin to do this automatically (there are plans for a Redis plugin) but, hopefully, this page is enough to give you an idea of how this can be achieved.
          Feel free to share your plugin with us if it's generic enough.
        </p>
        <p>
          When reading this documentation, it's important to keep in mind that your SocketCluster system could have multiple brokers; in
          such a case, each broker will only manage a subset of all available channels (responsibilities will be somewhat evenly
          distributed between each broker).

        <table class="table">
          <tr>
            <td>id</td>
            <td>The broker's id. This is also the broker's index - So the first broker's ID will always be 0.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>options</td>
            <td>
              This is the options object provided through the brokerOptions property when you initialize your SocketCluster instance (inside server.js).
              This can be useful if you need to pass command line arguments from your master process to your broker when you run SC.

          <tr>
            <td>instanceId</td>
            <td>
              The ID of the current SocketCluster instance. A single SC instance constitutes of the master process and all of its child processes -
              This includes worker and broker processes which were forked from master.

          <tr>
            <td>dataMap</td>
            <td>
              A FlexiMap (<a href="https://github.com/SocketCluster/fleximap">https://github.com/SocketCluster/fleximap</a>) containing all data for the current broker.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>dataExpirer</td>
            <td>
              An ExpiryManager (<a href="https://github.com/SocketCluster/expirymanager">https://github.com/SocketCluster/expirymanager</a>) which holds a list of expiries for various keys in dataMap.
            </td>

          <tr>
            <td>channelMap</td>
            <td>
              A FlexiMap (<a href="https://github.com/SocketCluster/fleximap">https://github.com/SocketCluster/fleximap</a>) containing all channels managed by the current broker.
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        <h3>Events:</h3>
        <table class="table">
          <tr>
            <td>'subscribe'</td>
            <td>
              This gets triggered whenever a SocketCluster worker subscribes to a channel. When a worker subscribes to a channel,
              it means that at least one client-side socket which is bound to that worker has asked to subscribe to that channel.
              A worker will not try to subscribe to the channel again if it is already subscribed to it.<br />
              <br />
              For the purpose of scaling SocketCluster across multiple machines, if you see this event triggered for a particular
              channel, then you know that the current broker is interested in that channel, so you can use an MQTT, AMQP, or Redis client
              of your choice to create a matching channel subscription on a remote Pub/Sub cluster - This allows you to extend the subscription
              to an external pub/sub service.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>'unsubscribe'</td>
            <td>
              This event will get triggered when a worker unsubscribes from a channel on the current broker.
              A worker will unsubscribe itself from a channel when it no longer has any client-side sockets which want to be subscribed to that channel.
              A worker will only unsubscribe to a channel if it is subscribed to it.<br />
              <br />
              Like the 'subscribe' event described above, you can use this event to unsubscribe your broker process from a particular
              channel on a remote Pub/Sub cluster.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>'publish'</td>
            <td>
              This event will be emitted whenever a worker publishes data to a particular channel on the current broker.
              The worker may publish data to a channel on a broker when one of its client-side sockets asks to publish to that channel or
              when you call worker.exchange.publish(...) from the worker process.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>'masterMessage'</td>
            <td>
              Emitted when the master process sends a message to this broker.
              The only parameter passed to the handler is the object/message sent from master.
              See sendToBroker() method in <a href="/#!/docs/api-socketcluster">master SocketCluster API</a> for details on how
              to send a message to a broker from the master process.
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        <h3>Methods:</h3>
        <table class="table">
          <tr>
            <td>publish(channelName, data)</td>
            <td>
              Publish data (can be any valid JavaScript object/type) to channelName on the current broker.
              <br />
              For the purpose of scaling to multiple SC instances, this method allows you to inject external
              channel data (from your remote cluster) into relevant SocketCluster channels.
              <br />
              Because this method publishes data directly from the broker itself, the broker will not emit a 'publish' event -
              The 'publish' event only gets emitted when a worker publishes data.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>run(query)</td>
            <td>
              Execute a query function on the current broker. See <a href="http://github.com/SocketCluster/sc-broker">http://github.com/SocketCluster/sc-broker</a> for details.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>sendToMaster(data)</td>
            <td>
              Send some data to the master process from this broker. You can handle this message from inside the master process by listening for the
              'brokerMessage' event. See <a href="/#!/docs/api-socketcluster">here</a> for more details.
