        <h1>Full stack pub/sub with SocketCluster</h1>
        <p>
          In addition to Socket.io style emit/on functionality, SocketCluster also lets you interact with real-time pub/sub channels from either the client or the server using JavaScript (NodeJS on the server).
          By defining middleware functions, SC gives you complete control over your real-time data. Middleware can be used to block clients from subscribing and
          publishing to particular channels but they can also be used to transform your real-time streams (on the backend) before they reach other clients.
        </p>

        <p>
          Note that this diagram represents the architecture for SC v1.x.x - In SC v2.0.0+, there is no sticky load balancer layer; instead, workers share the same port and pick up new connections based on which one is the least busy.
          The diagram is a bit generic, but you could assume that channel 1, channel 2, channel 3&hellip; represents different chat rooms which clients can join â€“ Each room could focus on a particular topic, for example let's say 'math', 'physics', 'chemistry' &hellip; To listen to all messages posted in the room 'physics', all you have to do on the client is call:
        </p>

        <pre class="prettyprint">
// SocketCluster API v1.0.0
var physChannel = socket.subscribe('physics');

physChannel.watch(function (data) {...});</pre>
        <p>
          To send messages to the physics room; you would just call:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint">socket.publish('physics', messageData);</pre>
        <p>... or</p>

        <pre class="prettyprint">physChannel.publish(messageData);</pre>

        <p>
          Note that channels don't have to be shared by multiple users - You could setup channels for individual users. For example, the user with username 'bob123' could subscribe and watch the channel 'bob123' - That way if any other user that wants to send some data to bob123, they can simply call:
        </p>

        <pre class="prettyprint">socket.publish('bob123', {from: 'alice456', message: 'Hi Bob!'});</pre>

        <p>
          By default, SC allows anyone to subscribe and publish to any channel they want - It lets you specify middleware on the server to allow or block specific users from subscribing, publishing or emitting certain events. Examples:
        </p>

        <pre class="prettyprint">
scServer.addMiddleware(scServer.MIDDLEWARE_SUBSCRIBE, function (req, next) {
  // ...
  if (...) {
    next(); // Allow
  } else {
    next(req.socket.id + ' is not allowed to subscribe to ' + req.channel); // Block
  }
});</pre>

        <pre class="prettyprint">
scServer.addMiddleware(scServer.MIDDLEWARE_PUBLISH_IN, function (req, next) {
  // ...
  if (...) {
    next(); // Allow
  } else {
    next(req.socket.id + ' is not allowed to publish to the ' + req.channel + ' channel'); // Block
  }
});</pre>

        <pre class="prettyprint">
scServer.addMiddleware(scServer.MIDDLEWARE_EMIT, function (req, next) {
  // ...
  if (...) {
    next(); // Allow
  } else {
    next(req.socket.id + ' is not allowed to emit the ' + req.event + ' req.event'); // Block
  }
});</pre>
        <p>
          SocketCluster also exposes an Exchange object on the server-side (scServer.exchange) through which you can publish events to clients:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint">scServer.exchange.publish(eventName, data, cb);</pre>
        <p>
          An emitted event is only sent to the other side of the socket (I.e. server &#8594; client or client &#8594; server); on the other hand, data published to a channel will be sent to all subscribed client sockets (and nobody else!).
        </p>
        <p>
          To subscribe a client socket to a channel, you just use:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint">
var channelObject = socket.subscribe(channelName);</pre>
        <p>
          Then, to handle incoming channel data, you just use:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint">
channelObject.watch(handlerFn);</pre>
        <p>
          Note that subscription requests will have to pass through the SUBSCRIBE middleware before the client can receive channel events.
