        <h1>API - SCSocket (Server)</h1>
        <p>
          Note that there are two types of SCSocket objects - One which runs on the client and another which runs on the server.
          These two objects have slightly different APIs. This page concerns the server socket.
        </p>
        <p>
          The server-side SCSocket object allows you to interact with a matching client-side socket in realtime.
          It also allows you to subscribe and publish to channels. It uses the WebSocket API as the underlying transport.
        </p>

              This error object has an additional ecryptedAuthToken property which holds the encrypted token
              which failed the verification step.

              If a callback is provided, your server-side socket will need to respond to this event. <a href="#!/docs/handling-failure">See example</a>.

          </tr>
          <tr>

            <td>
              Add a handler for a particular event (those emitted from a corresponding socket on the client). The handler is a function
              in the form: handler(data, res) - The res argument is a function which can be used to send a response to the client socket which
              emitted the event (assuming that the client is expecting a response - I.e. A callback was provided to the emit method).
              The res function is in the form: res(err, message) - To send back an error, you can do either: res('This is an error') or
              res(1234, 'This is the error message for error code 1234').
              To send back a normal non-error response: res(null, 'This is a normal response message').
              Note that both arguments provided to res can be of any JSON-compatible type.

              <p>
                Authenticate the current socket's client by providing it with a secret token which validates their identity and/or access rights.
                You should only call this method in response to a successful login attempt by the client (I.e. The client has provided
                a username and password combination which exists in your database).
              </p>
              <p>
                In the simplest case, the data argument to this method would be an object in the form {username: 'bob123'}.
                For a more complex use case, you could store a list of authorized channel names inside the token (for convenience so that you can simply read the token instead of checking the database every time).
              <p>
                The optional <b>options</b> argument is an Object which can be used to modify the token's behavior - Valid properties include any
                option accepted by the node-jsonwebtoken library's sign method.
                <a href="https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken#jwtsignpayload-secretorprivatekey-options">See list here</a>.
                Note that if you use a different algorithm from the default 'HS256', you will need to make sure that your authKey is in the correct format.
                (I.e. a PEM encoded private key for RSA and ECDSA). See authKey option in SocketCluster constructor <a href="/#!/docs/api-socketcluster">here</a>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Using auth tokens has the following advantages:
                <ul>
                  <li>The user doesn't need to login again if their socket loses its connection - Works well with SC's auto-reconnect feature.</li>
                  <li>
                    An auth token is shared between sockets across multiple tabs in a browser (under the same domain name).
                    If a user logs in on one tab, they will automatically be authenticated on any other tab that they may have open.
                    Tokens allow you to glue multiple sockets together under a single user identity.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </p>

          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>removeAuthToken()</td>
            <td>
              Disassociate the current socket from its current auth token.
              This method will also tell the client socket to remove the token from the browser's cookies.
              This is useful for logging out the user.

              Forcibly unsubscribe this socket from the specified channel.
              All arguments are optional - If no channel name is provided, it will unsubscribe this socket from ALL channels.
              In addition, the client-side of this socket will emit a 'kickOut' event and a 'dropOut' event to signify that
              it was kicked out of the channel and has dropped out of further messages.
              Note that this doesn't prevent the client from resubscribing to that channel later. You will need to update your middleware
              if you want to achieve this.
