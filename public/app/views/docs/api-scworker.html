        <p>
          This instance is passed to your worker file's run() method.
          It represents your current worker.

              The Node.js HTTP server associated with this worker.
              Note that this server's 'request' event will not trigger for requests which are handled internally by SocketCluster.
              If you would like to handle all requests (including ones for URLs reserved by SC), you will need to listen for the 'rawRequest' event.
              This is not recommended though unless you know what you're doing.

              See sendToWorker() method in <a href="/#!/docs/api-socketcluster">master SocketCluster API</a> for details on how
              to send a message to a worker from the master process.

              Returns the SCServer instance associated with this worker.
              Note that you no longer have to use this method; you can now simply access the worker.scServer property directly instead.

          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>getHTTPServer()</td>
            <td>

            <td>setAuthEngine(authEngine)</td>
            <td>
              Set a custom auth engine for use throughout SC. This new engine will be used internally to create/sign and verify auth tokens.
              The provided auth engine will become accessible from the 'worker.auth' property inside your workerController (worker.js).
              The provided authEngine needs to provide a 'verifyToken' and a 'signToken' method - See the
              <a href="https://github.com/SocketCluster/socketcluster/blob/master/lib/auth.js">default engine</a> for details.

              Send some data to the master process from this worker. You can handle this message from inside the master process by listening for the
              'workerMessage' event. See <a href="/#!/docs/api-socketcluster">here</a> for more details.

                        This middleware will run before SocketCluster's underlying HTTP/WS server starts listening for connections - It
                        allows you to perform some async logic to prepare your worker before it starts handling connections.
                        The options object passed to this middleware function will be the SC instance's internal options object.
