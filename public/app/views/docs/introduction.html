        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
          SocketCluster is a fast, highly scalable HTTP + WebSockets server environment which lets you build multi-process realtime systems that make use of all CPU cores on a machine/instance. It removes the limitations of having to run your Node.js server as a single thread and makes your backend resilient by automatically recovering from worker crashes and aggregating errors into a central log.
        </p>
        <p>
          SocketCluster works like a pub/sub system (which extends all the way to the browser/IoT device) - It only delivers particular events to clients who actually need them. SC is designed to scale both vertically (as a cluster of processes) and horizontally (multiple machines/instances).
        </p>
        <p>
          SC was designed to be modular so that you can run other frameworks like express on top of it (or build your own!).
          SC's realtime API is similar to that of Socket.io.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can use SocketCluster as a standalone framework (to act as both a HTTP and WebSocket server) or use it only as a realtime engine and serve the client script separately. See <a href="http://npmjs.org/socketcluster-client">http://npmjs.org/socketcluster-client</a>.

        <h2>Memory Leak Profile</h2>
        <p>
          SC has been tested for memory leaks. The last full memory profiling was done on v0.9.17 (Node.js v0.10.28) and included checks on worker and broker processes. No memory leaks were detected.
